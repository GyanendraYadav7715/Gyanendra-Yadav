## Overview

This project is a modern **E-commerce Grocery Web Application** designed to make online grocery shopping seamless for customers and easy to manage for administrators. Customers can browse products, add items to their cart, place orders, and track them in real-time. On the other side, admins can manage product inventory, monitor orders, and update stock efficiently.  

The platform is built with **React (frontend), Node.js/Express (backend), and MongoDB (database)**, ensuring scalability, performance, and a clean user experience.

## Key Features

- **User Features**
  - Add/remove items to a cart in real-time.
  - Save delivery addresses and manage multiple shipping details.
  - Place and track orders easily through a personalized dashboard.
  - Responsive design for smooth mobile and desktop usage.

- **Admin Features**
  - Add, update, and remove grocery items from inventory.
  - Manage stock levels and ensure availability.
  - View order history and track ongoing orders.
  - Role-based access for admin and staff.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, React Router, Redux (for state management), TailwindCSS  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Database**: MongoDB with Mongoose ODM  
- **Authentication**: JWT-based secure login for users and admins  
- **Deployment**: Hosted on AWS with CI/CD for continuous delivery  

## Challenges and Learnings

One of the major challenges was handling **real-time cart updates** across different user sessions and ensuring the checkout flow remained smooth even with high traffic. Another challenge was designing the **admin panel for inventory management** that was both simple and powerful.  

By implementing optimized MongoDB queries and Redux for state management, the app achieved **fast load times and smooth interactions**. Building this project deepened my understanding of **scalable backend architecture, secure authentication, and modern frontend practices**.  

## Outcome

The project successfully provides a **complete digital solution for grocery shopping**. Customers can order groceries from the comfort of their homes, while admins gain a centralized dashboard for managing inventory and tracking sales. This application demonstrates strong **full-stack development skills** and the ability to build a **real-world, user-focused platform** from scratch.
