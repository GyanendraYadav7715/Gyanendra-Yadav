## Overview

Comprig is a cloud platform I built to simplify how users interact with virtual machines. Instead of relying on local clients like RDP or SSH, Comprig enables users to create, start, stop, and access **Ubuntu and Windows VMs directly in the browser**.  

The platform integrates **Terraform, AWS EC2, Apache Guacamole, and Wetty** to fully automate VM provisioning, connection management, and billing. With a clean React frontend and a Node.js + MongoDB backend, Comprig is designed to be scalable and user-friendly, catering to developers, teams, and enterprises looking for seamless cloud computing access.

## Key Features

- **Automated VM Provisioning**: Users can create Ubuntu or Windows EC2 instances through the web interface. Terraform scripts handle the infrastructure setup while Node.js manages orchestration.
- **Browser-based Access**: 
  - Windows VMs accessible via **Apache Guacamole** (RDP in-browser).
  - Ubuntu VMs accessible via **Wetty** (SSH terminal in-browser).
- **User Dashboard**: Displays created instances, usage time, and billing details. Includes controls for starting/stopping machines.
- **Billing System**: Tracks VM usage and charges based on runtime. Future expansion includes team billing and shared VM access.
- **Security & Authentication**: JWT-based user authentication and automated Guacamole integration ensure secure VM connections.
- **Scalability**: Modular design with Terraform and prebuilt AMIs makes it easy to extend to other cloud providers like GCP and Azure.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, TypeScript, React Query, Tailwind CSS, Zustand  
- **Backend**: Node.js (Express), MongoDB, JWT Authentication  
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform, AWS EC2, S3, VPC, Security Groups  
- **Remote Access**: Apache Guacamole (Windows GUI), Wetty (Linux CLI)  
- **Deployment & Automation**: Docker, CI/CD Pipelines  

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Guacamole Automation**: Automating user and connection creation in Apache Guacamole required deep integration with its REST API.  
- **VM Lifecycle Management**: Ensuring Terraform, backend, and frontend stayed in sync for start/stop/delete events.  
- **Billing Accuracy**: Designing a billing system tied to actual VM runtime demanded precise tracking and robust error handling.  
- **Scalability**: Planning for thousands of users required careful decisions on database schema, API efficiency, and caching.  

## Outcome

Comprig successfully delivers a **cloud-native, browser-based VM platform**. It bridges the gap between developers and cloud infrastructure by removing the need for external clients.  

Users can now spin up a VM in seconds and access it securely in their browser. The project demonstrates expertise in **cloud automation, full-stack development, and scalable architecture design**.
