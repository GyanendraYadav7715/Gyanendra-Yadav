## Overview

In this project, I focused on automating the often tedious design handover process. The goal was to create a pipeline that converts Figma designs directly into clean, production-ready code. By integrating design tokens, component libraries, and automated workflows, this solution significantly reduced the time spent on translating design assets into code, while maintaining design consistency across the product.  

In parallel, I also worked on a **Digital Aadhaar Update System** that streamlined how admins, retailers, and back-office teams manage Aadhaar updates. This solution aimed to provide a secure, scalable, and accessible platform for handling customer Aadhaar modifications without manual bottlenecks.

## Key Features

### Figma to Code Pipeline
- **Figma Plugin Integration**: Developed a custom Figma plugin that extracts design tokens such as colors, typography, and spacing values, and exports them in a format compatible with our codebase.
- **Code Generation**: Automated translation of Figma components into React code using a combination of design tokens and component templates.
- **Continuous Sync**: CI/CD pipeline that keeps design updates synced with the codebase in real-time.
- **Scalable Design System**: Unified design system as the single source of truth.

### Digital Aadhaar Update System
- **Role-Based Access**: Built role-based dashboards for admins, retailers, and back-office operators to handle Aadhaar updates with different permission levels.
- **Retailer Portal**: Retailers can securely initiate Aadhaar update requests for customers, ensuring compliance and real-time status tracking.
- **Back-Office Automation**: Automated workflows for verifying, approving, or rejecting Aadhaar update requests, reducing manual overhead.
- **Audit & Security**: End-to-end encryption, audit logs, and OTP-based verification to ensure Aadhaar data integrity and trust.

## Technologies Used

- **Figma API**: Extracting design tokens and component data.
- **React & Next.js**: Clean, reusable UI components.
- **Styled-Components**: Dynamic styling with design tokens.
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated pipeline for syncing design changes.
- **Node.js & MongoDB**: Backend infrastructure for Aadhaar update system.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: For admin, retailer, and back-office separation.
- **Secure APIs**: Aadhaar service integration with encryption.

## Challenges and Learnings

- **Figma Pipeline**: Ensuring generated code remained clean, responsive, and maintainable. Required mapping Figma components intelligently to React structures.  
- **Aadhaar System**: Managing large-scale Aadhaar update requests demanded strict security, OTP integration, and strong role management. Balancing usability with government compliance was a critical learning.

## Outcome

- **Figma Pipeline**: Reduced design-to-development time by **40%**, ensuring design consistency and developer efficiency.  
- **Aadhaar Update System**: Delivered a scalable solution for **retailers, admins, and back-office teams**, reducing manual workload, cutting processing errors, and enabling secure Aadhaar update workflows.
